Lang: en
---

**The OGD Handbook is designed as a wiki to which anyone can contribute content – in particular, those who are responsible within their organization for publishing data on *opendata.swiss*. You can make suggestions for changes, new topics or corrections on the pages themselves.**

## Editing content

Before you begin editing, please check the [list of open issues](https://github.com/opendata-swiss/ogd-handbook-wiki/issues) to see whether someone else has already suggested your change. If not, proceed as follows:

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in. Take a moment to read the explanations displayed by GitHub.
2. Return to the [OGD Handbook](http://handbook.opendata.swiss/) and click on “Edit” on the page you wish to change.  
3. Make your changes, using either the simple editor or the Markdown programming language. Please note the changes you have made in the form at the bottom of the page.  
4. When you are satisfied with your changes, click on “new pull request”. Your changes will now be saved as a new version of the page – referred to in GitHub as a “fork”.
5. We will now review your changes. You will be notified by e-mail as soon as your version is online.
