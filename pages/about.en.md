**_handbook.opendata.swiss_ contains instructions and guidelines for publishing data on _opendata.swiss_. It is designed as a wiki. opendata.swiss is supplying the initial content, which will then be complemented by the experiences of the authorities publishing data.**

The OGD Handbook at handbook.opendata.swiss is a collection of instructions to assist authorities in publishing their data. It also includes existing guidelines such as the metadata standard for the portal catalogue. The texts follow the order of activities required for the publication on opendata.swiss, from identifying potential open data to support for users during operation.

The Handbook relies on the experiences of the authorities publishing data. They are invited to input these to the texts at handbook.opendata.swiss. The way to do this is [explained here](/en/pages/contribute).

More information about the opendata.swiss portal can be [found here](https://opendata.swiss/en/about/). The OGD Switzerland project, under which opendata.swiss and the Handbook have been developed, is presented on the [egovernment Switzerland](https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/e-government-schweiz-2008-2015/open-government-data-schweiz/) website. [Contact us](http://opendata.swiss/en/contact/) if you would like to work on the Handbook or have questions.
